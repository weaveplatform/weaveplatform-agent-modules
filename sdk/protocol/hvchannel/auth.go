// Authenticating the channel.
//
// The channel is a device node inside the guest and a pair of pipes outside it.
// Anything on the host that can reach those pipes can drive the guest — power it
// off, run a command in it, read its inventory — so without this the boundary is
// "whoever got to the file descriptor first". That is not a boundary.
//
// The guest holds a public key placed there when its image was built; the host
// holds the matching private key in the VM's directory. The guest issues a nonce,
// the host signs it, the guest checks the signature against the key it already
// trusts. Ed25519, as the device identity already uses.
//
// # Per VM, not per host
//
// The keypair belongs to one VM. A process able to drive VM A therefore cannot
// drive VM B, which a host-wide key would have allowed the moment it leaked —
// and the blast radius of a leaked host-wide key is every guest on the machine.
//
// # What is answerable before authentication
//
// Two things, and deliberately only two:
//
//   - The auth handshake itself. A caller that gets a challenge back knows an
//     agent is listening.
//   - PreAuthKind, the guest agent's hello.
//
// Everything else is refused until the signature checks out — fail closed, not
// fail quiet. The narrow exception exists so a caller can tell "wrong key" from
// "no agent at all": those need different responses from an operator, and a
// channel that answered nothing pre-auth would make them identical. Neither
// exception discloses anything the existence of the channel does not: liveness,
// and which agent build is running.

// ControlModule addresses a frame to the channel itself rather than to a module.
// It is a reserved module id — manifest.Validate refuses it — so no module can
// be published under this name and quietly find its traffic intercepted, or
// worse, be in a position to answer for the channel.

// channel — and both ends have to agree on it exactly.
