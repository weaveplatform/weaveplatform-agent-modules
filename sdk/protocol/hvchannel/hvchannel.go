// Package hvchannel is the framing and addressing format of the hypervisor
// channel — the single byte pipe (virtio-serial / vsock / HvSocket) between
// core running inside a guest and the host tooling outside it.
//
// BOTH ends must encode identically and there is no negotiation to catch a
// mismatch: the guest end is core's transport peer, the host end is a
// product's client, and a field renamed on one side would simply stop matching
// on the other. Core keeps its own copy of this package
// (weaveplatform-agent-core's internal/protocol/hvchannel), so unlike the
// generated protocol nothing keeps the two in step: a change here is a
// protocol change and must land in core as well.
//
// This is a different wire from the module protocol (weave/agent/v1). Adding it
// is additive and does not move the protocol integer — see agent-core's
// docs/PROTOCOL.md.
//
// # The single-owner rule
//
// The format has NO resynchronisation. A frame is a length and then exactly
// that many bytes; a reader that loses its place cannot find the next boundary,
// so a desynchronised stream stays broken rather than degrading. Therefore each
// end must have exactly ONE reader and serialise its writes. Callers are
// responsible for that discipline — this package deliberately provides no
// locking, because a mutex here would imply it was safe to hand the same
// connection to two owners.

// guestwire kinds) is product logic and lives with the modules, not in the
// platform API.
//
// ID is an optional correlation the sender chooses. Core never reads Data, so
// a reply core makes on a module's behalf — delivery.failed — can only be
// matched to the host's pending call by something outside Data: core echoes
// ID on every control reply to a frame that carried one. It is omitted when
// empty, so a peer built before it existed neither sends nor sees it, and a
// decoder that does not know the field ignores it. A host sets it to the
// request id inside Data (weavewire.Command.ID), so one pending-call table
// matches both a module's reply and core's answer on its behalf.
